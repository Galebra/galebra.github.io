<p>
    Look, let's make it clear. We hate apps that make business out of personal data. We hate them.<br />
    The app Photos &amp; Videos Memories uses data collected in the
    Microsoft Partner Centre for the sole purpose of figuring out bugs and usage statistics.
    These are provided by default to us by the Microsoft Partner Center in order to enhance
    this app. For instance, the Microsoft Partner Center provides our developers with information on crashes,
    daily acquisitions, daily active users, failure hits, ratings and reviews.
    These are all useful for us to provide a better app. We made this app to be good for us, not to be good for you only.
    Strictly speaking, this Privacy Policy does not apply to such a third-party store from which you
    install the app or make payments. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any
    such third party but we tell you about that such that you remain informed.
</p>
<p>
    The app contains links to Youtube for tutorials about this app. Youtube is not affiliated with us. Once you have used
    these links to leave the app, any information you provide to these third parties is not
    covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your
    information. In general, we are not responsible for the content or privacy
    and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other sites, services or
    applications that may be linked to or from the app.
    You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in
    question.
</p>
<p>
    Your personal information is used only if you communicate it to us, typically an email, to suggest a feature or report a bug
    or contact us for any other reason via the feedback mechanism provided by Microsoft and available through our app.
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy may change from time to time and we will post the amended terms on this site and make reasonable
    efforts to notify users of major changes. The last revision will be reflected in the “Last Updated” date above.
    Amended terms will take effect immediately. Hence, you should review the Privacy Policy periodically to remain informed
    of any changes. You agree to accept the posting of a revised Privacy Policy as actual notice to you.
    Your continued use of this app after any changes to this Privacy Policy have been posted as of the “Last Updated” date
    above signifies your acceptance of those changes.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not agree to the revised Privacy Policy, please refrain from using this app and feel free to contact us
    for improvements or requests at:
